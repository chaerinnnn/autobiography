            <div class="description">The moment I stepped forward as a junior-high school student, there were infinite possibilities for me. And among them, the expanded world of coding was very attractive to me. I remember the moment when curiosity about coding began to spring up for the first time.<br>
                
               <br> At that time, the term computer science felt like a mysterious world to me. The reason I became interested in this unknown territory came from trying to create a simple game. It was a truly magical experience for what I made to work on a computer screen.<br>
                
               <br> Initially, I experimented constantly with simple code, and thought about how to get better results. Coding has become a great tool for me to develop my problem-solving skills, and learning a computer language was as interesting as learning a new language.<br>
                
               <br> Computer science is a constantly changing and evolving field, and exploring new technologies and ideas in it has been truly an amazing experience. When I was in middle school, coding was the key to opening up the technology world of the future, and through it, I could see the possibility of unleashing endless creativity. My coding journey continues, and my desire to learn more and create my own work in this infinite world has become stronger.</div>
